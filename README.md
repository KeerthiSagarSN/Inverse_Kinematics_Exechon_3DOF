# Inverse_Kinematics_Exechon_3DOF
A visual planner of the Exechon - 3 DOF parallel manipulator.

Exechon parallel manipulator has 3 linear actuators, where two actuators lie on a rotating plane and the third actuator along a spherical joint.
The detailed kinematic equations have been described in the research paper " Zoppi, Matteo, Dimiter Zlatanov, and Rezia Molfino. "Kinematics analysis of the Exechon tripod." ASME 2010 international design engineering technical conferences and computers and information in engineering conference. American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 2010."
